					<h6>
						Collaboration is at the heart and soul of the Abriendo Puertas / Opening Doors model. The &ldquo;train-the-trainers&rdquo; approach relies on partnerships with local agencies, and state and national organizations that share our values and priorities. Working together, we support parents as leaders of their families, schools and communities. <br><br>
						Parents have the most important job in the world. The parenting path is often rewarding&hellip;sometimes challenging&hellip;and lasts a lifetime. This journey can be especially daunting for parents whose primary language is Spanish and for those who work hard yet struggle to make ends meet. In every Abriendo Puertas/Opening Doors session, we hear parents say, &ldquo;I came here to work hard, so that my children will have more opportunities than I’ve had, and so they will have a better life.&rdquo; It is our hope that Abriendo Puertas/Opening Doors will be a significant contribution to making that aspiration a&nbsp;reality.

							<h6>&ldquo; ‘Transformative’ is often used by families to describe their experience in the Abriendo Puertas classes we implement in New Mexico. The curriculum not only helps families gain knowledge around children’s early development, but it is also a tool for organizing and developing leaders in communities.&rdquo;</h6>

							<h6>&ldquo;I love this country and work hard so that my family can have opportunities and an education that I’ve never had. I enjoyed the Abriendo Puertas program and met other women just like me – we all want the best for our kids. The experience helped me understand my role as the leader of my family. I’ve now set goals and made plans to reach them, step by step. For example, with reading&mdash;I don’t want Miguel to not read well, I learned a lot of kids don’t and it’s hard for them to catch up. Miguel is 3 years old. We have fun going to the library, reading books and telling stories. It’s like the saying&mdash;If you don’t look forward, you stay behind. He will go to a University one day.&rdquo; </h6>–<em> Liz Ochoa, Parent</em>
						</p>

						<hr>

						<p>
							<h6>&ldquo;Thanks to Abriendo Puertas I’ve become my children’s advocate and improved my relationship with my family.&rdquo;</h6>
							<em> – Dioselina Alcaraz, Parent</em>
						</p>

						<hr>
													
						<p>
							<h6>&ldquo;Before Abriendo Puertas I didn’t know how to really get involved in the parent committee at my child’s school. I didn’t know I had rights to demand thing because I am not from this country. I would arrive at my child’s schools with such insecurity about whether I should or shouldn’t be there. After Abriendo Puertas I know how navigate the system, and I now go to these meetings.&rdquo; </h6> <em>- Nindi, Parent </em>
						</p>

						<hr>
						
						<p>
							<h6>&ldquo;I wasn’t use to reading to my child… Now, after Abriendo Puertas, I read to him much more frequently and I try to be more animated. I have also been helping him more with his homework. His teacher is telling me that he has been advancing in his grade since I started doing this.&rdquo;</h6><em>- Edelina, Parent</em>
						</p>
						
						<hr>

						<p>
							<h6>
							&ldquo;Before Abriendo Puertas I didn’t even step a foot into the library; I now go there all the time&hellip;I now take my children frequently to the library. There were things about the library that I was completely unaware of&mdash;like books in Spanish.&rdquo;
							</h6><em>- Nayeli, Parent </em>
						</p>

						<hr>

						<p>
							<h6>&ldquo;I have a new awareness and knowledge that not only helps me but others as well, after Abriendo Puertas. For example, I now know about different school services, what a child should be learning developmentally, and how to fight for someone’s rights.  I often get asked by my neighbors for support&hellip;I accompanied a parent to an IEP meeting at her child’s school, and was able to help her support her daughter.&rdquo; </h6><em>- Felipa, Parent </em>
